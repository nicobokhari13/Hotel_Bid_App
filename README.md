# Hotel Bidding Application

By: Nico Bokhari 

This project allows the user to enter and submit a bid for a hotel room. This project implements the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern so a bid is handled by a bid handler according to its value. The bid's handle responsibility is deferred to a successsor handler if there is a more specialized handler for finding a hotel room within the bid's price range. 

## Purpose

This software was created to demonstrate my knowledge of the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern for the course CIS476: Software Architecture & Design Patterns offered at University of Michigan-Dearborn. I completed this course as a requirement for my Software Engineering degree.
